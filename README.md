# Earthquake Analysis: Bangladesh Region

This project provides an analysis of earthquake patterns in and around the Bangladesh region. The primary goal is to identify any unusual seismic activity by examining temporal trends, magnitude distributions, spatial clustering, and other seismological parameters using publicly available earthquake data.

## Project Organization

The repository is structured as follows:

```txt
├── README.md # This file
├── analysis.ipynb # Main Jupyter Notebook for the earthquake analysis
├── analysis_100_y.ipynb # Notebook for a 100-year analysis
├── data/ # Contains the raw earthquake data
│ ├── query.csv
│ ├── query.json
│ ├── query_01.csv
│ └── query_last_100_years_from_2025.csv
├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies for the project
├── res/ # Stores generated results like plots and images
│ └── 2025/
│ ├── README.md
│ ├── depth_dis.png
│ ├── e_count.png
│ └── ... (other generated plots)
└── shallowness-analysis_100_y.ipynb # Notebook focused on depth analysis over 100 years
```

- **`analysis.ipynb`**: The core of the project, this notebook contains all the steps from data loading and preprocessing to statistical analysis and visualization.
- **`data/`**: Holds the earthquake catalog data.
- **`res/`**: Contains visual outputs such as charts and maps generated by the analysis notebooks.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A list of all Python libraries required to run the analysis.

## How to Execute the Analysis

Follow these steps to set up your environment and run the analysis notebook.

### 1. Python Environment Setup

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Executing the Analysis

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the analysis using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

```bash
# Start Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab

# Or start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to and open the analysis.ipynb file in the Jupyter interface. You can then run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.
